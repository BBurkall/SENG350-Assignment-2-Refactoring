SENG350 Assignment 2: Refactoring

Assignment for my SENG350 class at Ferris State University.

Assignment details below:

An excellent example on refactoring comes from Martin Fowler's book. 

The following repo contains examples from chapter 1 of the book. 

The author follows the book's steps to refactor the code step by step. This shows in the git repository commit history.

1- Review the read me file and review the repo in general. 

2- You will notice that the version tagged 1.0 is the original "bad" code then the author proceeds to refactor it. 

Update: for step 2 here is  some additional clarification on git tags in case you need it . 

also here is a short articles on what git tags mean https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-TaggingLinks to an external site.
here is how to use them in github  https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/managing-tagsLinks to an external site.
You can use GitHub Desktop to create, push, and view tags.

3- start from the first version and code along with the author as he refactors the code using the following refactoring techniques 

extract method 
move method 
rename method 
replace temp with query
 delete

4- Share a link to your repo. 

5- Now, choose a previous project or a full repo you have worked on before. Apply these refactoring techniques or any other 4 techniques that you prefer from the list in source making to your project or repo. 

6- your commit history should show the changes you are making in an organized way ( don't fix everything in one commit then share). 

7- Preferably, use 1 commit per refactoring technique 

8- Submit links to both repos. (the replica from the example I shared and your refactored project).

9- the project should be of substantial size. Projects with less than 100 lines of code are too small to see the impact of refactoring on. 

10- If you do not have a project large enough, you may pick a public repo that you think would benefit from these techniques.
